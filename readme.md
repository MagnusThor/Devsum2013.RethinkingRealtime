# Devsum2013.RethinkingRealtime ( WebRTC and more )

## About

This repo contains the example code written during my session at DevSum2013 in Stockholm may 2013.

The example will give you a 1-n audio/video "conference web-app" using WebRTC and XSockets.NET.

You will find the code in the src folder and the presentation as a PDF file located in the presentation folder.

Enjoy
